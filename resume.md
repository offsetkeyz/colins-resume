I am a people-first cybersecurity leader who believes that empowering individuals through encouragement and constructive feedback is key to fostering both personal and professional growth. My leadership approach is hands-off, allowing my team the freedom to take ownership of their work while providing the support they need to succeed. I tailor my leadership style to each individual, ensuring that they feel valued and confident, rather than forcing them to adapt to me. By focusing on clear communication, collaboration, and a culture of trust, I create environments where people can thrive and perform at their best. At Arctic Wolf, I lead with the belief that happy, healthy, and productive teams are the foundation of cybersecurity excellence.
